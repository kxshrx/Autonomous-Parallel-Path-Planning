# Autonomous Parallel Path Planning System

A modern web application demonstrating advanced parallel pathfinding algorithms for autonomous navigation systems. This project compares the performance of parallel vs sequential implementations of popular pathfinding algorithms using real-world road networks.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system implements and compares 5 different pathfinding algorithms:

- **Parallel Dijkstra** – Multi-threaded shortest path algorithm
- **Parallel A\*** – Heuristic-based parallel pathfinding
- **Parallel Bellman-Ford** – Parallel edge relaxation algorithm
- **Sequential Dijkstra** – Traditional shortest path algorithm
- **Sequential A\*** – Traditional heuristic pathfinding

The application uses Chennai's road network as a test environment to demonstrate real-world performance differences between parallel and sequential algorithm implementations.
